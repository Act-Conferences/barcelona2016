    <p>
      The Barcelona Perl Mongers, as part of the Perl Community,
      believe our community should be truly open for everyone.
      As such, are committed to providing a friendly, safe and
      welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender,
      sexual orientation, disability, ethnicity, religion,
      preferred operating system, programming language, or
      text editor.
    </p>

    <p>
      We therefore ask all our members, speakers, volunteers,
      attendees and guests to adopt these principles. We are
      a diverse community. Sometimes this means we need to
      work harder to ensure we're creating an environment of
      trust and respect where all who come to participate
      feel comfortable and included.
    </p>

    <p>
      We value your participation and appreciate your help
      in realising this goal.
    </p>

    <h2>Be respectful</h2>

    <p>
      Respect yourself, and respect others. Be courteous
      to those around you. If someone indicates theys
      don't wish to be photographed, respect that wish.
      If someone indicates they would like to be left alone,
      let them be.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Be considerate, respectful, and collaborative.
      </li>
      <li>
        Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory or harassing
        behavior and speech.
      </li>
      <li>
        Be mindful of your surroundings and of your
        fellow participants.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Be inclusive</h2>

    <p>
      All presentation material should be suitable for
      people aged 12 and above. Any public presentation
      which is part of any event, including but not limited
      to keynotes, presentations, lightning talks, addresses,
      mailing list posts and forums, is subject to this
      code of conduct and thus may not contain:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>sexual or violent imagery;</li>
      <li>exclusionary language;</li>
      <li>insults or ad-hominem attacks.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      If the content of the presentation requires includings
      language that could be considered offensive, this
      should be pointed out in advance, at the beginning of
      the talk and in the schedule.
    </p>

    <p>
      If presenters are unsure whether their material is
      suitable, they are encouraged to show it to the
      conference's speaker liaison or mailing list/forum
      moderators before their session.
    </p>

    <h2>Be aware</h2>

    <p>
      We ask everyone to be aware that we will not tolerate
      intimidation, harassment, or any abusive, discriminatory
      or derogatory behaviour by anyone at any event or online.
    </p>

      confidential and be taken seriously. The complaint will
